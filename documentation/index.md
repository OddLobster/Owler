OWler is an open-source focused web crawler that navigates the [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) to downloads WARC files and store extracted content into an index. 
It collects web pages that satisfy some specific criteria, e.g., URLs that belong to a given domain or that contain a user-specified topic. 
In it's early version, OWler aims to use URL classifiers to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant content in a given domain.

OWler supports many features, such as:
- Regular crawling of a fixed list of web sites
- Continuous re-crawling of sitemaps to discover new pages
- Discovery and crawling of new relevant web sites through automatic link prioritization
- Indexing of crawled pages using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
- Web interface for navigating crawled pages in real-time and for for crawler monitoring
- Configuration of different types of URL classifiers (machine-learning, regex, etc.)
