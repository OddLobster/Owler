ensure you are on a linux based OS


in the root directory clone the following repos:
owler:
    git clone https://github.com/OddLobster/Owler
owler utilities:
    git clone https://github.com/OddLobster/OwlerUtil
url-frontier:
    git clone https://github.com/crawler-commons/url-frontier.git

(Optional):
    owler-installation-toolkit:
        git clone https://opencode.it4i.eu/openwebsearcheu-public/owler-installation-toolkit.git


generate corpus embedding file from web data:
    navigate to OwlerUtil/SeedGathering/seeds.py
    install all requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
    run: python seeds.py
    this will generate a seeds_earth_observation.txt file, that can be used as starting seeds (the reference corpus embedding will be generated from the text of these urls as well)
    Additionally, the script will generate a corpus_embedding_d_0.hdf5 file
        move this into the owler repository under data/model/  (create folders if they dont exist)
    The seeds URLs for the crawl should currently be in the root directory of Owler (where all of the dockerfiles are) (will refactor this soon)
        the file has to be named: seeds.txt (or change it in the Dockerfile.owler)

Convert BERT model into onnx format:
    move into the root directory of OwlerUtil
    run the following commands:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python convert_bert.py
    copy the resulting bert-base-uncased.onnx file into /data/model of the Owler repository

before running owler:
    install ansible
    move into the ansible folder and run the ansible playbook that sets up the storm user and downloads apache storm and apache zookeeper
    run: ansible-playbook -i hosts storm-playbook.yml --ask-become-pass


    provide your AWS key in dev.properties to generate WARC files


run owler:
    change to owler root directory and run: make run




Additional stuff:
    make sure the docker daemon is running
    make sure youre logged in to docker with: docker login

    if you cant install the requirements.txt upgrade your pip:
        pip install --upgrade pip
