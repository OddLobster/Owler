ensure you are on a linux based OS


in the root directory of the project (not the owler root directory) clone the following repos:
owler:
    git clone https://github.com/OddLobster/Owler
owler utilities:
    git clone https://github.com/OddLobster/OwlerUtil
url-frontier:
    git clone https://github.com/crawler-commons/url-frontier.git

(Optional):
    owler-installation-toolkit:
        git clone https://opencode.it4i.eu/openwebsearcheu-public/owler-installation-toolkit.git


generate corpus embedding file from web data:
    navigate to OwlerUtil/SeedGathering/seeds.py
    create a python virtual environment
    install all requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
    run: python seeds.py (This will take some time)
    this will generate a seeds_earth_observation.txt file, that can be used as starting seeds (the reference corpus embedding will be generated from the text of these urls as well)
    Additionally, the script will generate a corpus_embedding_d_0.hdf5 file

Convert BERT model into onnx format:
    move into the root directory of OwlerUtil
    run the following commands:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python convert_bert.py


    provide your AWS key in dev.properties to generate WARC files


run owler:
    make sure to have java, maven and docker installed

    init files with: sh init.sh
    build and run owler:  make run

After a few minutes a warc file should be generated in output/warc
You can inspect the logs under logs/worker-artifacts to identify issues




Additional stuff:
    make sure the docker daemon is running
    make sure youre logged in to docker with: docker login

    if you cant install the requirements.txt upgrade your pip:
        pip install --upgrade pip
